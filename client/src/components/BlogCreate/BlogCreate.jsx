// 1. Implement reusable form that takes method and updatingData as a props, same manner as update feedback working.
// Form using formHolder component and behaving differnetly depending on method POST or PATCH, as well as titles and all constants.
// Img required for create, when not required for update.
// 2. Implement blogpost update page (no image), blogpost create page (with image).
// 3. Implement users update page (no image), user create page (no image)

// this should be a reusable form pretty much and form holder which accepts and passed by method and updatingData props
